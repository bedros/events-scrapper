# Event-screaper

A web scraping program to generate an ical calandar file from a list of Facebook events pages.
The goal is to retrieve events without having to spend hours on FB. Unfortunately Facebook has won and the majority of events are announced and shared on FB, even when the bands or venues have their own website. 

Facebook Graph API no longer supports events, so this script uses selenium. The use of selenium and web scarpping in general is contrary to Facebook's terms of use.
If you remain reasonable about the number of pages, the frequency of use, don't use selenium in headless mode, tor or otherproxy, it shouldn't be a okay.

For the kinkiest among you, the script supports authentication to access pages reserved for adults. If you use the authentication function and play dumb, you risk having your account slowed down, number of captcha increase or even banned. You've been warned, there's no need to come crying to me afterwards.

I use this script twice a day for about 40 pages and I haven't had any problems.
